<br/>
<br/>
The Dataset used for these: [CFPW_Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chinafax/cfpw-dataset) The dataset is directly taken up from Kaggle and used in the Kaggle notebook directly.
We used 1500 images of celebrity frontal profile, 3 images for each of the 500 celebrities were taken and worked upon.
